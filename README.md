# Automatic-Water-Tank-Controller-VHDL
The Aim of our Project was to build an automatic water
tank filling and Rainwater storage system using a
VHDL-based interface. As we know, if we have 2 water
tanks at our homes, we need to manually turn the
motor direction of each tank for filling water. To solve
this, we designed this automatic system that
senses the level of water in each tank and operates the
motor accordingly. Additionally, to conserve rainwater
we use another tank which is placed underground
where the sensors sense the level of water in the tanks
and redirect it to the underground tank. We also
incorporate an alarm and LED for indicating the filling
of water in the tanks.
